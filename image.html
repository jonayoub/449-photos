               <h1> The Sport of Soccer</h1>
               <p>Numerous people all over the world enjoy and play the sport of soccer. Football is another name for it that is used in many nations. 
                  The objective of the game, which is played between two teams of 11 players each, is to score goals by kicking the ball into the goal post of the opposition. 
                  The ball can be kicked with any part of the body except the arms and hands in soccer, which is played on a rectangular field with goalposts at either end 
                  (unless the player is the goalkeeper within their penalty area). 
                  The game is thrilling and difficult for both players and spectators because it calls for a combination of skill, speed, agility, and teamwork.
